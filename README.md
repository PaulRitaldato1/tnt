# The TnT Engine

TnT is a 2d Game Engine written in C++. At the time of speaking the engine uses features from the C++17 standard (as there is no C++ compiler that fully supports C++20 features), but one of the goals of the engine is to use C++20 features wherever possible.

## Project Goals

The project aims to make game development easy enough for anybody that doesn't know C++. Meanwhile the engine should be powerful enough for a C++ developer.

## Features

* Fast 2d rendering.
* Efficient Entity management.
* Fast and easy GUI library.
* Lightweight logging.
* Networking support.
* Data serialization (save into/load from file).
* Scripting support.
