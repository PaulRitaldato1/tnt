# The TnT Engine

TnT is a 2d Game Engine written in C++. At the time of speaking the engine uses
features from the C++17 standard (as there is no C++ compiler that fully
supports C++20 features), but one of the goals of the engine is to use C++20
features wherever possible.

## Project Goals

The project aims to make game development easy enough for anybody that doesn't
know C++. Meanwhile the engine should be powerful enough for a C++ developer.

## Features

- Fast 2d rendering.
- Efficient Entity management.
- Fast and easy GUI library.
- Lightweight logging.
- Networking support.
- Data serialization (save into/load from file).
- Scripting support.
